Hello, so this is my report about the week01 task.
This week's lab assignment is about some introductions to github, putty, badak, and many more things related to the OS lab tasks ahead.
And also there's an introduction to a "old but new" thing, which is git
I've learnt git from PPW class last semester and using GitHub is mostly the same as GitLab in PPW class.
This week's tasks teach me how to run some commands such as creating a folder, and many more.
